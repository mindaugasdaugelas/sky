      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>As the sequel Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light follows the same gameplay formula. With the player character, Artyom, journeying across linear sections of a Post-Apocalyptic Metro System and an irradiated surface of post-apocalyptic Moscow, hoping to save what's left of humanity, long after World War III. In this inhospitable landscape, the player must guide Artyom into following friends, battling dangerous mutants, and engaging in firefights with enemy factions, or complex stealth missions in which remaining unseen is vital for survival.
      <br>
      <br>
      The story takes place after Metro 2033, with a new story guided by Dmitry Glukhovsky but written in-house at 4A-Games. The story continues on from the canonical ending of the previous game, in which Artyom destroyed the mysterious new mutant threat, the Dark Ones. In this setting, Artyom's allies: Khan and other Rangers, join forces once again to defend D6 from many foes including the Fourth Reich, communists and bandits. With this new installment 4A has introduced a multitude of new weapons, such as the bolt-action rifle, a single-shot pistol, a hand powered chain gun, as well new locations to play in.

      <h1>Gameplay changes</h1>
      <span>
        <h2>World Management</h2>
        <p>From the first trailers, it was shown that Artyom's watch would be significantly different in Last Light.
        Instead of the, at-times confusing system of the three LEDs and three coloured areas on Artyom's dive-watch,
        Artyom's new watch is digital. The new watch replaces estimated filter time, with concise digital numbers 
        which indicate how much time Artyom has left in his filter - with each filter starting the countdown at exactly five minutes.
         Replacing the three LEDs for the stealth indicator is now a simple single blue light that states if Artyom can or can't be seen.
        Augmenting this is in stealth missions is a shrill horn sound effect, that plays when Artyom is in danger of being spotted and must move immediately.
        </p>
      </span>
      <span>
        <h2>Combat</h2>
        <p>In response to criticisms of lacklustre combat in 2033, weapon reload times, battery charge time, and Artyom's
         movement has all seen an increase in efficiency or "tightness". 4A games have given the in-universe explanation that
        this is to signify Artyom's expertise with weaponry, now that he is a ranger. These changes have been met with mixed 
        reactions from long-time fans of Metro 2033, with many praising the high-quality controls but criticizing the general
        ease of combat left by it.
        Weapons such as the grenade and the throwing knives are given their own devoted sub menu. Appearing only in the standard di
        fficulties, with the menu open the game slows down about four times. This could be very effective at some times, especially
        when entering an area where the player suddenly faces an enemy, as it is a very good way to evaluate the situation, and get
        time to think. Besides that, the player can shoot while ADS (aiming down sights) and reload, but not when looking down the iron sights.
        The only drawback is that it is still impossible to aim down the sights while reloading, but the player can strafe and duck to attempt to hit their target.
        The sounds also warp in the same way as some of the cinematics, and when smoking the "bong" in Venice.

      <h1>Major Factions</h1>
      <span class="mySludes">
        <img src="../img/metroLLrangers.jpg">
        <h1>Rangers of the Order</h1>
        <p>A para-military organization considered the protectors of the Metro, the Rangers, also known as Spartans, venture the Metro and the surface, eliminating mutants and bandits who prey on the weak. Although neutral, they maintain close ties with Polis (itself a neutral power), with many members hailing from The City. They possess no home stations, instead of occupying the surface base of Sparta, and the D6 bunker. Their leader, Miller, enforces a policy of 'if it's hostile, you kill it', which has served the Rangers well so far. Many members were previously Russian special forces or military, training which has helped the Rangers to gain a reputation as the most formidable fighters in the Metro. About 250 men and women can claim the honor of being Spartans, with 100 in the field at any time. This is also Artyom's faction.</p>

        <h1>Fourth Reich</h1>
        <p>A far-right faction inspired by the ideas and policies of Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich. Led by the FÃ¼hrer and formed around a core of Neo-Nazis and pre-war xenophobes, the Reich strives to build a New Order, envisioning a Metro free of mutants and non-Russians. To this end, they employ special instruments and techniques (modeled upon those used in Hitler's Germany) to ensure that genetic "standards" are upheld by all inhabitants of and travelers to the Reich. Their home station is the triple station of Tverskaya-Chekhovskaya-Pushkinskaya, though they occupy many other stations and bases on the surface. In a state of perpetual war with their political opposites, the Marxist-Leninist Red Line, the Reich possesses an army of between 2,000 and 3,000 men. Preferring (partially as a result of their smaller population) quality to quantity, Reich soldiers are significantly better equipped and trained on a man-to-man basis than their more numerous red counterparts, a situation which clearly parallels the Eastern Front of World War II.</p>

        <img src="../img/metroLLhanza.jpg" width="1000px">
        <h1>The Commonwealth of the Stations of the Ring Line</h1>
        <p>Commonly shortened to "Hansa", this faction is a collection of stations led by President Pyotr Rusakov and occupying the vital Koltsevaya Ring Line. Formed soon after the collapse of Central Metro Command, Hansa is the most influential faction in the Metro. Occupying what could be considered the "jugular" of the entire metro system, trade from every station and faction in the Metro passes through Hansa checkpoints. To protect its sovereignty, security, and trade revenues, Hansa possesses a potent force of 4000 to 5000 soldiers. Despite this impressive ensemble, Hansa remains something of an apathetic bystander to strife in the tunnels, preferring to use sanctions and threats when necessary to protect the Commonwealth's interests.</p>

        <img src="../img/metroLLreds.jpg" width="1000px">
        <h1>Red Line</h1>
        <p>A Marxist-Leninist and Neo-Stalinist faction, the Red Line is the haven of Soviet nostalgists and aging former members of the CPSU and Komsomol. Led by General Secretary Maxim Moskvin, the Communist Party maintains control much as in Stalin's time- through a program of censorship, political and social repression, and webs of spies and informants. The Reds occupy most of the Sokolnicheskaya Line (literally, "Red Line"; the oldest in the Metro and a constant reminder of the glories of Russia's socialist past) minus the two stations of the Ring, and possess the largest population and greatest territory in the Metro. Much like the Soviet Army of the Second World War, the Red Line relies on a massive, but poorly trained and equipped, conscript army. Of the Line's 15,000 citizens, 6,000-7,000 serve in the Armed Forces, engaged in a constant struggle against the Neo-Nazis of the Fourth Reich.</p>

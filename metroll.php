      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>As the sequel Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light follows the same gameplay formula. With the player character, Artyom, journeying across linear sections of a Post-Apocalyptic Metro System and an irradiated surface of post-apocalyptic Moscow, hoping to save what's left of humanity, long after World War III. In this inhospitable landscape, the player must guide Artyom into following friends, battling dangerous mutants, and engaging in firefights with enemy factions, or complex stealth missions in which remaining unseen is vital for survival.
      <br>
      <br>
      The story takes place after Metro 2033, with a new story guided by Dmitry Glukhovsky but written in-house at 4A-Games. The story continues on from the canonical ending of the previous game, in which Artyom destroyed the mysterious new mutant threat, the Dark Ones. In this setting, Artyom's allies: Khan and other Rangers, join forces once again to defend D6 from many foes including the Fourth Reich, communists and bandits. With this new installment 4A has introduced a multitude of new weapons, such as the bolt-action rifle, a single-shot pistol, a hand powered chain gun, as well new locations to play in.

    <h1>Gameplay changes</h1>
      <span>
        <h2>World Management</h2>
        <p>From the first trailers, it was shown that Artyom's watch would be significantly different in Last Light.
        Instead of the, at-times confusing system of the three LEDs and three coloured areas on Artyom's dive-watch,
        Artyom's new watch is digital. The new watch replaces estimated filter time, with concise digital numbers 
        which indicate how much time Artyom has left in his filter - with each filter starting the countdown at exactly five minutes.
         Replacing the three LEDs for the stealth indicator is now a simple single blue light that states if Artyom can or can't be seen.
        Augmenting this is in stealth missions is a shrill horn sound effect, that plays when Artyom is in danger of being spotted and must move immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Combat</h2>
        <p>In response to criticisms of lacklustre combat in 2033, weapon reload times, battery charge time, and Artyom's
         movement has all seen an increase in efficiency or "tightness". 4A games have given the in-universe explanation that
        this is to signify Artyom's expertise with weaponry, now that he is a ranger. These changes have been met with mixed 
        reactions from long-time fans of Metro 2033, with many praising the high-quality controls but criticizing the general
        ease of combat left by it.
        Weapons such as the grenade and the throwing knives are given their own devoted sub menu. Appearing only in the standard di
        fficulties, with the menu open the game slows down about four times. This could be very effective at some times, especially
        when entering an area where the player suddenly faces an enemy, as it is a very good way to evaluate the situation, and get
        time to think. Besides that, the player can shoot while ADS (aiming down sights) and reload, but not when looking down the iron sights.
        The only drawback is that it is still impossible to aim down the sights while reloading, but the player can strafe and duck to attempt to hit their target.
        The sounds also warp in the same way as some of the cinematics, and when smoking the "bong" in Venice.
